# üëã Hi, I'm Jiapei Li

I'm currently a graduate student in the **Master of Science in Business Analytics** program at **Boston University**, with a strong passion for data-driven problem-solving and business strategy.

Before pivoting into analytics, I completed my **Bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering**, which equipped me with quantitative thinking and system-level planning skills. During my studies and internships, I discovered a strong interest in bridging data insights and decision-making ‚Äî which brought me to the world of business analytics.
